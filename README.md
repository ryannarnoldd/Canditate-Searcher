The usage of this application is simple. The user can search for candidates by going to the home page. The user can then click on the "Add" button to add the candidate to their "Saved Candidates" list. The user can also click on the "Reject" button to remove the candidate from the search results. The user can view more if they go to Saved Candidates, where they can then further reject users.
